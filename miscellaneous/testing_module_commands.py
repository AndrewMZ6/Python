# the script is used for checking commands of module while reading documentation
# the scenario is to import module for example sys
import sys
# then create a name "command" to represent function of the module or attribute
# without () at the end
# for example "sys path". Since the it's an attribute it falls into category "not callable"
# and the result will be just printted without trying to call it
command = sys.path

# on the other hand if we want to test method getwindowsversion() of the module
# we also do this
command = sys.getwindowsversion

# but this time command becomes "callable" and gets called

if callable(command):
	print('callable:', end='\n\n')
	print(command('gdsg'), end='\n\n')

	print(list(filter(lambda s: not s.startswith('_'), dir(command))))
else:
	print('not callable:', end='\n\n')
	print(command, end='\n\n')
	print(list(filter(lambda s: not s.startswith('_'), dir(command))))
