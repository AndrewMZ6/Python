# tThe idea of the unique_list class
# is to add functionality to build-in class list
# that removes duplicates but saves the order of the 
# elements

# The first step is to create algorithm of how to
# filter duplicates and keep order

	pass

L1 = [1, 8.1, 9, 52.3, -6.1, 0, -90, 4, 52.3, 3.14, 3.14]  # len(L1) == 11
print(f"original list:\n{L1}")
S1 = set(L1)
new_list = list(S1)
print(f"new_list:\n{new_list}")

# output:
# [0, 1, 3.14, 4, -90, 8.1, 9, 52.3, -6.1]


# Problem:
# elements of new list are not in the same order as 
# were in original list L1

# Algorithm:
# order = dict()
# for element in new_list:
# 	ind = check what was the index of the element in the original list
#	
#	check if order dict already contains the element as a key
#	
#   add key/value pair to the order dictionary where key is the element
#	and value is it's index in the original list
#	
# 	create zeroed list of length len(order)
# 	for value, index in order.items()
#	place into zeroed list at index index the value
#   	WARNING! since len(order) is less than len(L1)
# 		some indexes are get out of range! For example
# 		3.14 in the original list L1 had index 9, but new zeroed list's
# 		max index is 8
